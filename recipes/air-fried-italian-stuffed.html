        Garlic, Parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and toasted nuts turn brown rice<br>

        dish that's cooked in the air fryer.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>RECIPES:</h3>
    <ul>   
        4 medium tomatoes<br>
        olive oil, as needed<br>
        1 cup cooked brown rice<br>
        ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br>
        ¼ cup crumbled goat cheese<br>
        ¼ cup chopped toasted walnuts<br>
        2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided, or more to taste<br>
        2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        ¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided<br>
        1 tablespoon olive oil<br>

    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS:</h3>

    <ol>
        1. Cut tops off tomatoes and scoop out flesh with a melon baller,<br>
        leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick sides and bottoms. Discard tomato<br>
        tops and flesh. <br>
        2. Brush the bottom of an air fryer basket with olive oil. <br>
        3. Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, <br>
        1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread crumbs,<br> 
        and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes with rice <br>
        mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place stuffed tomatoes <br>
        into the prepared air fryer basket<br>
        4. Cook in the air fryer at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) until tomatoes <br>
        are tender, filling is heated through, and topping is golden brown, <br>
        about 15 minutes. Garnish with remaining basil. <br>
