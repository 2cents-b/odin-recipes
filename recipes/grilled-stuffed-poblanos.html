    <h3>RECIPES:</h3>
    <ul>
        8 poblano peppers<br>
        5 ears corn, husks and silks removed<br>
        1 (15-ounce can) no-salt-added black beans, drained and rinsed<br>
        1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro<br>
        1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano<br>
        2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        1 teaspoon salt<br>
        1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
        1/4 teaspoon black pepper<br>
        2 tablespoons butter<br>
        2 tablespoons flour<br>
        1 cup milk<br>
        1 cup shredded pepper Jack cheese<br>
        1 cup pico de gallo<br>
        cilantro leaves, lime wedges, and/or radish slices, for serving (optional)<br>
        chili powder, for garnish<br>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS:</h3>

    <ol>
        1. Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, lighting burners<br>
        on just one side or pushing lit coals to one side. Preheat to medium-high<br>
        heat(375 to 400 degrees F (180 to 200 degrees C)). Lightly oil grill grates<br>
        over lit side. <br>
        2. Grill poblanos and corn, covered, turning occasionally, until poblano<br>
        skins and corn are charred, about 10 minutes. Keep grill lit. <br>
        3. Transfer poblanos to a large bowl, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes.<br>
        Meanwhile, let corn stand until cool enough to handle; cut kernels from cobs.<br>
        4. Remove and discard poblano skins, keeping stems intact. Make a lengthwise slit<br>
        down one side of each poblano, starting at stem and being careful not to cut <br>
        through to other side. Remove and discard seeds and membranes.<br>
        5. Stir together beans, corn kernels, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, cumin, and<br>
        black pepper in a large bowl. Spoon about 1/2 cup bean mixture into each pepper,<br>
        enclosing pepper around the filling.<br>
        6. For the cheese sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat;<br>
        whisk in flour. Cook, stirring until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in <br>
        milk; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk <br>
        in cheese until melted. Remove from heat and keep warm, stirring occasionally.<br>
        7. Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed poblanos, <br>
        covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minute <br>
        8. Serve immediately with cheese sauce; pico de gallo; and (if using) cilantro, <br>
        lime wedges, and/or radishes. Garnish with chili powder. <br>
    </ol>
